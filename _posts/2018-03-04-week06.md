_Team Phaser, and Open Data Week plans_  

## Team Phaser Assessment and Plans  

For reference, our team is made up of Melissa, Marcus, Matthew, Daisy, and Gabe. We are working on [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser), a fun, free and fast 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile web browsers.  

#### Strengths and weaknesses of team

It seems like most of the group has some experience in web development, so across the board I think we'll do well working with a codebase that is primarily in JavaScript. As a downside, none of us have worked with the actual project before, so we'll each have to familiarize ourselves with it a bit more before we can understand the codebase a little bit better.

#### Common Meeting Times

1. 2pm Sundays
2. 6pm Wednesdays

#### Milestones

1. Learn Phaser by making a game together
2. Submit issues we find as we work in Phaser
3. Look at other issues once we’re familiar with the engine

## Plans for Open Data Week

I would like to attend at least two of these events this week!  

* Monday, March 5: NYC Open Data @ NYU   
* Tuesday, March 6: Data Through Design (Art Exhibit)  
* Wednesday, March 7:  City Hall Steps: Happy Birthday Open Data Law!
