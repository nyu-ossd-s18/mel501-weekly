_Project Progress, Questions for Danna, Open Data Week Event_  

## Project Progress  

Our group made great progress this week, narrowing the focus of our project. We have decided that our longterm goal for the project is to help fix the largely broken examples sandbox for Phaser 3 in two ways: fixing old examples broken by recent changes in the API, and adding new examples to highlight new features of the engine.  

I have been able to fix one example so far, and the PR for that fix has been merged. With this one fix correct, I am confident that I can fix several more with similar changes to the code. Moving forward, my specific role is to make fixes to broken examples within the Geom/Point directory in the **phaser3-examples** repository.  

## Questions For Danna, Google Software Engineer  

1. How do open source projects at Google differ from those by open source focused companies?  
2. How does a company with mainly proprietary software view the philosophy of open source tools and products?  
3. Are open source projects more or less valued at Google?  

## Open Data Week Event 2: The Missing Product Manger @ Civic Hall

Due to a snowstorm during Open Data Week, one of my events was postponed to March 28, 2018 at Civic Hall in the Flatiron District. I attended the event this week, and had a great time learning more about how open data promotes the expansion of civic technology as a field.  

The event began with talking about the importance of product (not to be confused with _project_) managers for developing digital products in government. Following this talk, a panel of civic tech experts from the NYC Department of Buildings, NYC Planning Labs, and the Mayors Office for Economic Opportunity spoke to their experience building digital projects in government.  

At the core of the talk was a general consensus that civic tech is under resourced. With the combination of bureaucracy in government paired with political motivations, government is not conducive to developing digital products in the way that private companies are able to. One thing I was surprised to hear from the panel was that they felt too many people still are not even aware of NYC Open Data, and the wats that they can use it. Because of this gap in awareness, many agencies within the New York City government do depend on some open source tools as a cheaper and reliable alternative to seeking proprietary resources.
