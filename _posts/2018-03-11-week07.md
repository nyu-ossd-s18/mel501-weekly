_Events I Attended for NYC Open Data Week!_  

## Wednesday, March 7: Data Through Design (Art Exhibit)  

This exhibit was hosted throughout Open Data Week, and featured works that used open data to respond to a particular question. One such question was "How is low-level crime policed throughout NYC?" An artist responded by creating a representation of an NYC maps with bunches of rope. Each color/pattern of rope represented a different low-level crime, bunched together by police precinct [pictured below].
