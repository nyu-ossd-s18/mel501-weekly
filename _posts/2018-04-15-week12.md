_Project Progress, and Contributions_  

## Project Progress  

This week, I shifted my focus a little to find new problems to work on. I finished up my initial goal of fixing all issues relating to the Geom/Point library, but it has been a little frustrating waiting to get feedback on the pull requests. Nonetheless, I have moved on to fixing some of the other issues in the Geom section, including the Line and Polygon libraries. I fixed two of those issues this week, and submitted PRs linked below! Moving forward, I might focus on enhancing some of the examples for Geom to better reflect the behavior of each function. If that turns out not to be viable, then I will continue to find issues for fixing.
