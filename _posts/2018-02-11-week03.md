_First Wikipedia Contribution_

[_Click here to see my contributions!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Melello)

## Finding Where to Make Contributions

I got started by checking out the _Articles Needing Cleanup_ category, because I figured I would not have too much difficulty adapting to Wikipedia's markdown. From there, long lists of subcategories by date are filled with articles needing extra help. Some of them I found didn't need much help at all, at least not help I was able to provide, but then I found the [Glucagon Rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon_rescue) page, which was full of broken links. I decided to go in a fix a couple of them that made sense to me.

## My First Contribution

My first contribution was fixing a couple of broken links. In the "Manufacturers of Glucagon rescue kits" section, there were two links to manufacturer brochures of the leading glucagon rescue kits. In both cases, these brochures used to be linked from the manufactures main website, but now these products each have their own websites full of much more information. Thus, I updated the links to reflect the migrated information.
