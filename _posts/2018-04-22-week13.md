_Project Progress, and Phaser Project License_  

## Phaser's License  

Phaser uses the MIT License for it's primary code base! With this license, most all actions one could imagine are allowed. Phaser's code can be modified, distributed, sublicensed in a work with a more restrictive license, and used commercially or privately. The one thing people must do is include the original copyright and license in any copies or derivative works. The original author(s) of the work are not to be held liable, since the work is provided "as is."

## Project Progress  

This week I wrote up a new example from scratch to replace a far-gone, broken example for Geom/Ellipse/Circumference Point, and submitted a PR! By lines of code, this has been one of my biggest contributions thus far. That contribution is linked [here](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/pull/138). I'm hoping to get feedback on it from the maintainer before the end of the semester!

As a group, the team and I focused on putting our presentation together for Tuesday, April 24th. [Here is a link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RvqHb_Uuuika4nDF1sxnTS19hqrcL5O-_VVcLwX8I2s/edit?usp=sharing) to what we have so far!


## Contributions This Week  

For clarity, this week I have updated the "Contributions" section of my blog to separate my individual contributions from my team contributions (because I realized I was grouping them all together when I shouldn't have)!

These contributions are the new, non-team contributions I made this week:
